# small_projects
Here is a collection of my selected small projects: 

- The genetic_algorithm.ipyn projects aims to develop a genetic algoritm which will train cellular automaton able to change any random set of black and yellow tiles into checkerboard
- The gray_scott.ipyn project consists of an implementation of gray-scott system of two substances simoultaneously reacting and diffusing. The system characterises an ability to create mesmerizing patterns.

Both projects contains exaple gifs in the example directory.
